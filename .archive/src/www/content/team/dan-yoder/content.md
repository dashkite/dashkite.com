- The [first multi-modal (voice, haptics, gesture) search applications][1] for smart phones (2008), which became the basis for the integrated voice search feature in AT&T's local search mobile application.
- The first fully open private equity exchange, SharesPost, taking it from proof-of-concept to a platform that has supported over $4.5B in transactions since it launched (2009).
- The [first serverless application platform][2] with integrated authentication, Spire.io (2012).
