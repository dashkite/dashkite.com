The Web is what we make of it. After all, it was built through public investment: it truly is _ours_. Silicon Valley didn’t create it: they just colonized it. We can still realize its incredible potential.

To do that, we need to make it [more sustainable][su], a concept borrowed from ecology. As applied to the Web, sustainability encompasses values that ensure that the Web becomes more than a gold rush.

The good news is that the technology that powers Web has become far more powerful over the past three decades. But the technology by itself is not enough: we need to rethink how we’re making use of it. That means challenging long-held and even cherished assumptions and accepted best-practices.

This encompasses everything from hiring practices to architectural decisions. For example, [DashKite's security model][au] is designed to minimize the amount of personal information our applications need, substantially reducing the risk of privacy breaches. That meant discarding a lot of the current state-of-the-art in security, because it assumes applications need access to private data.
