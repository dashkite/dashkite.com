# What Is DashKite?

by Dan Yoder

##### So what is DashKite?

DashKite is social media for humans: personal, private, and safe.

##### Isn't all social media for humans?

Existing social media platforms are for advertisers.

##### Why does that matter?

Moderation. Ad-based platforms lack the incentive to discourage abuse of the platform. Anything that increases engagement makes them money.

We're talking death threats, doxxing, bots, trolls, Nazis, ex-KGB…if it generates click-throughs, it's profitable.

##### But don't these platforms moderate already?

They talk about it. They make a show of it occasionally. But abuse is still pretty routine, which is what you'd expect, given the revenue model. For example, Ruby Rose, recently cast as Batwoman, [quit Twitter recently due to the resulting abuse](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/13/ruby-rose-batwoman-twitter/).

##### Without advertising, how do you make money?

Subscriptions!

##### Will people pay for social media?

People pay for e-books, music, film, TV, sporting events and concerts, and, increasingly, even journalism. *The New York Times* [reported in February](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulfletcher/2018/02/11/new-york-times-subscription-revenue-tops-1-billion-in-2017/#3314983a581b) that subscriptions account for 60% of its revenue, more than a billion dollars. People will also pay for social media.

##### But why would they pay for DashKite when the alternatives are free?

For the same reason people pay for streaming services. Even if the content is the same, you can watch it whenever you want, and you don't have to deal with ads. And when you're the customer, instead of advertisers, the incentives change, and the possibilities change. You get _Game of Thrones_ instead of _The Apprentice_. That's what effective moderation brings to social media.

##### Won't subscriptions dampen the network effects required to make the platform viable?

Subscriptions will be optional. Non-subscribers will simply see reminders in their feeds that we depend on a critical mass of subscribers to exist. In addition, some features may require a subscription to use. We can tweak these incentives to get the numbers we need to be profitable.

##### Which are?

We can get close to \$4 per active member per year, which is the baseline for emerging social platforms. We can do that with 5% of our members subscribing at \$6 per month, comparable to magazine subscription. These are conservative targets. For example, [Spotify's subscription rate is 25% at \$10 per month](https://www.fastcompany.com/3040781/a-whopping-25-of-spotifys-60-million-active-users-are-paying-customers). In addition, we won't need a sales team or ad platform, so our operating costs will be lower. We'd be sufficiently profitable at \$3.50 per person or even \$3.

##### Okay, presuming you can get enough people to subscribe, what makes DashKite's moderation so much better?

Communities.

Communities layer naturally on top of existing social networks, but the risk for existing platforms is that they may reduce engagement. They're an incredibly useful and underdeveloped feature and a gateway to effective moderation.

A DashKite community may be created by anyone. Creators are moderators and may delegate additional moderators. That means if they see abuse, they don't need to report it and put their faith in some opaque process or algorithm, they can take matters into their own hands and ban the abusers. People banned from a community are “ghosted” for its members—it's as if they didn't exist.

##### You're just crowdsourcing the moderation. That just makes it someone else's problem. Why pay for a service where you have do all the work?

The subscription is to pay for the service itself, in place of ads, not to pay for moderation. The difference is you're the customer now, you're empowered.

People already choose who to friend or follow or which groups to join and so on. No algorithm or support team can do that for you, at least not as well as you can. Communities just extend that idea, and take it to its natural conclusion.

You really don't want centralized moderation anyway. In the long run, we want these platforms to be decentralized, like email. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

##### Don't some platforms already have community-like features?

Other platforms have communities and some even allow for moderators. The idea isn't new, just underdeveloped. Making community features easy to use is a hard problem. If you're dependent on ads, you're probably not going to try very hard to solve it. And on several major platforms, those features just aren't there at all, except insofar as people find work arounds.

I'll make the analogy to TV again. NBC was never going to make _Game of Thrones_ or _Westworld_. Or even _Breaking Bad_. They needed least common denominator content. So we got _The Apprentice_ and _American Idol_. Or I guess the NBC version of that was _The Voice_.

Ad-based social media platforms don't want insular communities for analogous reasons. They want you on their platforms for hours, they want you to interact impulsively about things you probably don't care much about. If you could get what you need from social media with ten quality minutes, it would end them.

It's like the way grocery stores put the milk on the opposite side of the store from the cereal. Their optimizing for impulse buys, the same way social media platforms are optimizing for engagement—impulse interactions.

But a subscription-based service doesn't care about that. As long as you're getting value from the platform, and you think it's worth what you're paying, we're good. Community-driven moderation may reduce engagement but increases that value, so we're free to fully explore ways to make that as easy as possible to do.

##### You still have to deal with switching costs. I have to get all my friends to join, too. Isn't that why the dominant platforms are so hard to displace?

The reality is we see new platforms emerge better than every other year. In 2005, people thought MySpace was invincible. In 2007, they said that about Facebook. In 2009, it was Twitter. In 2011, it was Instagram. In 2013, it was SnapChat and WhatsApp.  There's also LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, and Reddit, each of which have tens of millions of monthly active users.

##### Is improved moderation enough to make it worth rebuilding my audience all over again?

Yes. At least for a critical mass of people.

Once you have people, like Ruby Rose, feeling like they're being forced to _leave_ the platform entirely, switching costs are, by definition, not the problem.

And without effective moderation, what's happening is that, even if you can stomach the abuse, people are subverting *your* message, hijacking *your* audience. It's a form of theft. You're working to build an audience—a community even—and people are stealing the value of that.

With community-driven moderation, those would-be thieves are effectively quarantined, and you reap the full benefit of the investment into the platform. And the quality of the conversion improves for everyone else.

Some people will see value in that. Some may not, at least not right away. We don't need everyone to switch. And not everyone will, and that's fine. But people are far more sophisticated about social media than ten years ago, and there's a lot of pent-up demand for a viable, safe alternative.

##### Let's make this more concrete. How do you get the first million people onto the DashKite platform? How do you get the first ten million?

Back in 2010. I wrote [a blog post arguing you should quit Facebook](https://www.businessinsider.com/10-reasons-to-delete-your-facebook-account-2010-5). Within a week of publication, the article was viewed several million times, distributed across multiple media sites, and translated into several languages.

The lesson for me: people care about social media and about privacy. But they feel they don't have good alternatives. We can give them one and get the word out and, if we do that well enough, we'll be fine.

##### There are already choices, aren't' there? Platforms like Mastodon, Diaspora, and others? Why is DashKite going to be more successful?

Those are all great projects and, if anything, DashKite will likely make them more attractive down the road. But, for now, there's nothing quite like DashKite. To begin with, none of them emphasize communities. Or, at the very least, they haven't made the concept accessible to consumers. More generally, they don't really solve the problems people have on existing mainstream platforms

##### What makes DashKite uniquely qualified to do that?

Experience, mostly.

When I wrote that blog post, I was the CTO for a social media startup. I was already thinking a lot about how we can do better, how to fully realize the potential of the Web. That startup failed, but I kept working the problem.

Community-driven moderation is just the start. There's a lot more we can do. For example, security is big part of the privacy picture. We have a security model called Human Factors Authentication that we think will make true privacy and security more accessible to consumers.

In the end, it takes a rare combination of skills to deliver on the promise of the Web and social media. You have to understand the technical issues associated with supporting millions of people and you have to understand the social dimension, the human dimension. That's what makes us unique.

##### You mentioned a roadmap. Is there a launch date? Can people apply to join a beta?

We expect to be to have a beta version ready in October. However, the launch plan is still under development. Stay tuned!
