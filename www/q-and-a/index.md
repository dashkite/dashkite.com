# What Is DashKite?

by Dan Yoder

##### So what is DashKite?

DashKite is social media for humans: personal, private, and safe.

##### Isn't all social media for humans?

Existing social media platforms are for advertisers.

##### Why does that matter?

Moderation. Ad-based platforms lack the incentive to discourage abuse of the platform. Anything that increases engagement makes them money.

We're talking death threats, doxxing, bots, trolls, Nazis, ex-KGB…if it generates click-throughs, it's profitable.

##### But don't these platforms moderate already?

They talk about it. They make a show of it occasionally. But [abuse is still routine](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/20/2020-candidates-social-media-attack-1176018), which is what you'd expect, given the revenue model.

##### So DashKite presumably would not rely on advertising to make money?

Right.

We're all connected by this magnificent global communications network, possibly the greatest leap forward for human interaction since the development of language, and the first thing we did with it was turn it into a giant billboard.

We can do better.

##### But without advertising, how do you make money?

Subscriptions!

##### And no advertising, or a mix?

No advertising.

##### Will people pay for social media?

People pay for e-books, music, film, TV, sporting events and concerts, and, increasingly, even journalism. *The New York Times* [reported an all-time high in subscriptions in 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/business/media/new-york-times-earnings-digital-subscriptions.html), topping 4 million subscribers and $400M in revenue. People will also pay for social media. It may take a little time to get used to the idea, but we believe it's inevitable.

##### Why would they pay for DashKite when the alternatives are free?

For the same reason people pay for streaming services even though they can watch many of the same shows for free on TV. Even if the content is the same, you can watch it whenever you want, and you don't have to deal with ads. And when you're the customer, instead of advertisers, the incentives change, and the possibilities change. You get _Game of Thrones_ instead of _The Apprentice_. That's what effective moderation brings to social media.

##### Won't subscriptions dampen the network effects required to make the platform viable?

Subscriptions will be optional. Non-subscribers will simply see reminders in their feeds that we depend on a critical mass of subscribers to exist. In addition, some features may require a subscription to use. We can tweak these incentives to get the numbers we need to be profitable.

##### What prevents you from moving to advertising down the road, once you're established?

Our thesis is that subscriptions can be as profitable, or even more profitable, than advertising. If 4% of our active members to pay a \$6 per month subscription for a nag-free experience, that would be as profitable as an emerging ad-based platform, or at least in the same neighborhood. The data we have on this is all over the place, and every platform is a little different, but those targets are reasonable, given what we know, maybe even conservative.

##### Presuming you can get enough people to subscribe, what makes DashKite's moderation so much better?

Communities.

A DashKite community may be created by anyone. Creators are moderators and may delegate additional moderators. That means if they see abuse, they don't need to report it and put their faith in some opaque process or algorithm, they can take matters into their own hands and ban the abusers. People banned from a community are “ghosted” for its members—it's as if they didn't exist.

##### Isn't that just crowdsourcing moderation? Why pay for a service where you have do all the work?

The subscription is to pay for the service itself, in place of ads, not to pay for moderation.

People already choose who to friend or follow or which groups to join and so on. No algorithm or support team can do that for you, at least not as well as you can. Blocking or banning someone is no different. We can, and will, _augment_ that, but we want you to have the last word, if you will.

And, in the long run, we want these platforms to be decentralized, like email. So we don't want to rely heavily on centralized moderation anyway.

##### Don't some platforms already have community-like features?

Other platforms have communities and some even allow for moderators. The idea isn't new, just underdeveloped. Making community features easy to use is a hard problem. If you're dependent on ads, you're probably not going to try very hard to solve it. And on several major platforms, those features just aren't there at all, except insofar as people find work arounds.

I'll make the analogy to TV again. NBC was never going to make _Game of Thrones_ or _Westworld_. Or even _Breaking Bad_. They needed least common denominator content. So we got _The Apprentice_ instead.

Ad-based social media platforms don't want insular communities for analogous reasons. They need you on their platforms for hours, they need you to interact impulsively about things you probably don't care much about. If you could get what you need from social media with ten quality minutes, they'd go out of business because they wouldn't be able to generate enough ad revenue.

It's like the way grocery stores put the milk on the opposite side of the store from the cereal. Their optimizing for impulse buys, the same way social media platforms are optimizing for engagement—impulse interactions.

But a subscription-based service doesn't care about that. All that matters is that you're getting value from the platform, and you think it's worth what you're paying. The amount of time you spend on it doesn't matter.

Community-driven moderation may reduce engagement but increases the value you get from the platform. And since we're subscription-based, we're free to fully explore features like this that would be nearly impossible for ad-based platforms because they need your time and attention to make money.

##### Let's make this more concrete. How do I ban someone on DashKite?

You ban them from your community. Much the way you might block or unfriend someone or whatever on another platform. Only now you're acting on behalf of everyone who is a part of that community. But you can only do this for communities you create or where you've been invited to be a moderator.

##### How do you create a community? And how do people join one?

You can compare this to a Facebook group or a hashtag on Twitter. You just start one. Or you look for one to join or maybe you see a post promoting it. So it's just another conversation that's happening on the Web. The big difference is that it's not just a page or a way to filter content. Without getting too far into the details, moderation can go beyond just banning trolls. We can also amplify useful content that improves that conversation.

##### You still have to deal with switching costs. I have to get all my friends to join, too. Isn't that why the dominant platforms are so hard to displace?

The reality is we see new platforms emerge better than every other year. In 2005, people thought MySpace was invincible. In 2007, they said that about Facebook. In 2009, it was Twitter. In 2011, it was Instagram. In 2013, it was SnapChat and WhatsApp.  There's also LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, and Reddit, each of which have tens of millions of monthly active users.

And the new platforms often co-exist alongside the existing ones. Facebook is still around. But so is Twitter and Reddit and so on. People routinely experiment with new platforms and are accustomed to juggling multiple accounts. We're get more savvy about how we use the Web every year. And this makes room for new platforms, new approaches, new ideas. The key is that you have to solve a problem for people. If you do that, they'll make room for you.

##### On the other hand, some people are heavily invested in a given platform, where they've built an audience. They don't want to start over again on a new platform. What does DashKite offer them?

In some cases, people are _leaving_ these platforms entirely. And without effective moderation, what's happening is that people are hijacking your audience. How many times have you been trying to read Facebook-powered comments and had to skip over the spam? Or seen a Twitter thread overrun with trolls?

With community-driven moderation, these attention thieves are thwarted, and you reap the full benefit of your investment into the platform. And the quality of the conversion improves for everyone else.

Some people will see value in that. Some may not, at least not right away. We don't need everyone to switch. And not everyone will, and that's fine.

And, again, you also don't need to make that leap of faith all at once. All we're asking for upfront is to do the same thing that people did with every other Web platform—try it out.

##### What makes DashKite uniquely qualified to create a better platform?

Experience, mostly.

Back in 2010, I wrote [a blog post arguing you should quit Facebook](https://www.businessinsider.com/10-reasons-to-delete-your-facebook-account-2010-5). Within a week of publication, the article was viewed several million times, distributed across multiple media sites, and translated into several languages.

The lesson for me: people care about social media and about privacy. But they feel they don't have good alternatives.

When I wrote that blog post, I was the CTO for a social media startup. I was already thinking a lot about how we can do better, how to fully realize the potential of the Web. That startup failed, but I kept working the problem.

Community-driven moderation is just the start. There's a lot more we can do. For example, security is big part of the privacy picture. We have a security model called Human Factors Authentication that we think will make true privacy and security more accessible to consumers.

In the end, it takes a rare combination of skills to actually deliver on the promise of the Web, to go beyond just using it as a giant billboard. You have to understand the technical issues but also the human dimension. We want a conversation, not an addiction. No one has all the answers, but I believe we're at least asking the right questions. That's what makes us unique.

##### Is there a launch date? Can people apply to join?

We expect to be to have a beta version ready mid-summer. Stay tuned!
