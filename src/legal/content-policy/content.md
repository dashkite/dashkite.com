# DashKite Content Policy

Last Revised August 8, 2020

DashKite is a collection of Services that collectively empower you to safely and securely share content over the Web. Through these services, you can post, comment, share, learn, debate, support, and connect with people who share your interests.

However, this capability should **never** be used as a weapon. Likewise, all our customers have an expectation of privacy and safety, so please respect the privacy and safety of others.

To that end, we have established rules governing the content available via DashKite services. We hope you will abide not only by the letter of these rules but their spirit as well.

## Rules

### Rule 1

If you harrass, bully, threaten, incite violence, or engage in hate speech, you will be summarily banned.

### Rule 2

Spam is not permitted. Do not attempt to manipulate content discovery.

### Rule 3

Respect the privacy of others. Instigating harassment, for example by revealing someone’s personal or confidential information is not allowed. Never post or threaten to post media without the express consent of those represented within it. 

### Rule 4

Do not post or encourage the posting of sexual or suggestive content involving minors.

### Rule 5

You don’t have to use your real name to use DashKite, but don’t impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.

### Rule 6

Ensure people have predictable experiences on DashKite by properly labeling content, particularly content that is graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive.

### Rule 7

Avoid posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal or prohibited transactions.

### Rule 8

Don’t break, or attempt to break, our Services, or do anything that interferes with normal use of DashKite.
