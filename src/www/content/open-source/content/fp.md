## Functional Programming

### Panda Garden

[Panda Garden][] provides a basic foundation for functional programming, including support for currying and partial application, composition of both synchronous and asynchronous functions, and common functional patterns, like memoization.

### Katana

[Katana][] simplifies function composition by using powerful stack combinators. Katana makes it easy to slice and dice function arguments to make composition easy and natural. Katana is a secret ingredient in many of our most powerful libraries, including Carbon and Quark (see _Browser Clients_).
