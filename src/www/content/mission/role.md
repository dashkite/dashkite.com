We’re starting simple, with applications that will allow us to test our innovations without gambling with people's privacy, safety, or well-being. In a sense, we're retracing the steps of the early Web, building it from the ground up with the advantage of hindsight.

Of course, we can't do that alone. We welcome [feedback][co] and look forward to working with others that share our desire to create a better Web. Together, we can create a Web where we’re more than just ad inventory. Where our privacy is respected. Where we don’t need to dance for an algorithm. Where we’re safe from abuse and harassment. Where we can be ourselves.
