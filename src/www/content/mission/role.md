Developing a new security model took a lot more time and effort than just doing what everyone else was doing. But if we keep doing things the same way we’ve always done them, we’ll keep repeating the mistakes of the past. Once we find a better way forward, we can share what we’ve learned, and the next time around, it’s a little bit easier.

We’re starting simple, with applications that will allow us to test our innovations without gambling with people's privacy, safety, or well-being. In a sense, we're retracing the steps of the early Web, hoping to learn from past mistakes.

Of course, we can't do that alone. We welcome [feedback][co] and look forward to working with others that share our desire to take back the Web. Together, we can create a better Web&hellip;and a better world.
