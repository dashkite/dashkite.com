In a remarkable leap of invention, the human race developed a global network that connects us all. We gave that network a friendly face and an evocative name: the World Wide Web. The excitement of those days might seem quaint or even naive to Web natives. The Web seemed poised to bring us closer together, strengthen communities, and empower individuals.
