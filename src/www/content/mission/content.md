We started DashKite to take back the Web. But what does that really mean?

## The Problem

In a remarkable leap of invention, the human race developed a global network that connects us all. We gave that network a friendly face and an evocative name: the World Wide Web. The excitement of those days might seem quaint or even naive to Web natives. The Web seemed poised to bring us closer together, strengthen communities, and empower individuals.

And that happened, but not quite how we imagined. The Web, as we know it, has become a platform for fraud, harassment, propaganda, and, ultimately, violence. That sense of hope and excitement that we felt in the early days of the Web has been replaced by one of dread and disappointment.

## The Solution

We need to take the Web back. After all, it was built through public investment: it truly is _ours_. Silicon Valley didn’t create it: they just colonized it. There’s nothing stopping us from taking it back. We can still realize its incredible potential.

To do that, we need to make it [more sustainable][su], a concept borrowed from ecology. As applied to the Web, sustainability [encompasses values][su] that ensure that the Web becomes more than a gold rush.

The good news is that the technology that powers Web has become far more powerful over the past three decades. But the technology by itself is not enough: we need to rethink how we’re making use of it. That means challenging long-held and even [cherished assumptions and accepted best-practices][su].

This encompasses everything from hiring practices to architectural decisions. For example, [DashKite's security model][au] is designed to minimize the amount of personal information our applications need, substantially reducing the risk of privacy breaches. That meant discarding a lot of the current state-of-the-art in security, because it assumes applications need access to private data.

## Our Role

Developing a new security model took a lot more time and effort than just doing what everyone else was doing. But if we keep doing things the same way we’ve always done them, we’ll keep repeating the mistakes of the past. Once we find a better way forward, we can share what we’ve learned, and the next time around, it’s a little bit easier.

We’re starting simple, with applications that will allow us to test our innovations without gambling with people's privacy, safety, or well-being. In a sense, we're retracing the steps of the early Web, hoping to learn from past mistakes.

Of course, we can't do that alone. We welcome [feedback][co] and look forward to working with others that share our desire to take back the Web. Together, we can create a better Web&hellip;and a better world.
