We started DashKite to provide a platform to help realize the real potential of Web. Today, the Web, as we know it, is basically a giant billboard and a vector for harassment, propaganda, and worse.

We want to take the Web back, to make it safe, secure, accessible, and empowering. The good news is that the technology that powers today's Web is incredibly powerful. We can harness that power to build a next-generation platform that prioritizes these qualities from the start.
