We started DashKite to provide a platform to help realize the real potential of Web. In a remarkable leap, humanity developed a global network that connected us all. We gave that network a friendly face and a hopeful and evocative name: the World Wide Web. Sadly, however, the Web, as we know it, has been reduced to a platform for fraud, harassment, propaganda, and, ultimately, violence.

We want to take the Web back and realize its massive potential to make the world a better place. In order to do that, we need to make it safe, secure, accessible, inclusive, responsive, and empowering. The good news is that the technology that powers today's Web is incredibly powerful. But the Web serves as a cautionary tale: technology by itself is not enough. Tech is never neutral. Our values must be part of the process from the start.

We build software with that idea as our guiding principle. For example, our security model is designed to minimize the amount of personal information our applications need, substantially reducing the risk of privacy breaches. This means questioning and often discarding existing “best practices” in favor of approaches that place people first.

This takes time: instead of _move fast and break things_, we _slow down and make things_&mdash;things that create real and lasting value. We're starting simple, with applications that will allow us to test our innovations without gambling with people's privacy, safety, or well-being. In a sense, we're retracing the steps of the early Web, hoping to learn from past mistakes, and create a better Web for the future.

Of course, we can't do that alone. We welcome [feedback][1] and look forward to working with others that share our belief we that we can take back the Web.
