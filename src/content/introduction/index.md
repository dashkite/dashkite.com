Today's major social media platforms are almost entirely ad-supported. That means they're for&hellip;advertisers. Advertisers need your attention to make sure you see their ads, so these platforms do everything they can to help them get it. This is called _maximizing engagement_. Maximizing engagement takes priority over other considerations, including your privacy, safety, securityâ€”and sanity. Which makes sense in a ruthless and amoral way, because, again, you aren't their customer, advertisers are. We might as well call these ad platforms.

Is there another way?

We believe there is. We built DashKite from the ground up to put you first. Safety, security, and privacy were literally the first things we focused on, rather than being something we tacked on at the end. Which makes sense if you're our customer. Of course, that also means that you need to pay for the service.

_Wait a minute,_ you say. _You want me to pay to use social media?_ Yes. We do. Or at least some of you. We will always offer a free version, but the paid version will offer more features, like being able to stream video. This is known as the _fremium_ model. But in principle, it's no different than paying for Netflix or Spotify. And maybe we're crazy, but we want to build this for _you_, not some ad agency.

That way, we can focus on creating value instead of capturing attention. And creating enough value that you're willing to pay us. (We're currently thinking \$6/month, but let us know what you think.) That means state-of-the-art security, strong privacy, and safety measures, like crowdsourced moderation. But more than that, we're free to focus entirely on what *you* need from us.

Because you're the customer.
